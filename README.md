# Exploring The Relationship Between Gun Ownership & Mass Shootings By State 

# Executive Summary

In the aftermath of every public mass shootings in the United States there is constant debate for and against the role guns and gun owners play. As a result, there are questions and suggestions that arise in trying to find a way to overcome the frequent occurrences of public mass shootings.

# Motivation

There are numerous studies on public mass shootings and gun control policies. Gun advocates say“guns don't kill people, people kill people” and there are numerous analyses to support and discredit such claims. I grew up in a country where guns are non existent among civilians and so are incidents related to gun violence. Given the importance of these issues and the continued controversy surrounding the debate on gun control in the United States,I want to work on this data to find out if there is a correlation between guns and mass shootings.

# Data Question

How do states with higher rates of gun ownership rank in relations to mass shootings ?
